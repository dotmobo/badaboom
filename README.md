It use the pico-8 game engine to have some RETRO feelings (pixel art graphism, fantasy console).

The game is inspired by the "Big Bada Boom" scene from the RETRO sci-fi movie "The Fifth Element", when Leeloo falls from the top of a building.

To respect the 96x96 screen size limitation, i added 16x16 borders on top, left, right and bottom of the screen, because pico-8 screen is natively 128x128.

The goal of the game is to avoid flying cars for as long as possible! Be careful, the fall speed is accelerating!
